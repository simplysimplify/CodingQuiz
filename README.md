# CodingQuiz

## Goals:

Create a modular setup for a quiz.

Create a setup that allowed for expansion in questions without sacrificing ease.

Create timer system for game overs.

Create multiple fields for entry.

Create a highscore field.

## Goals unmet:

Only multiple choice (not strictly required but wouldve been nice)

Modular setup is extremely scuffed and requires math to work in a modular way. (its straight horrible)
