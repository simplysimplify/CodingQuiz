# CodingQuiz

Goals:
Create a modular setup for a quiz. 
Create a setup that allowed for expansion in questions without sacrificing ease.
Create timer system for game overs.
Create multiple fields for entry.

Goals unmet:
Only multiple choice (not strictly required but wouldve been nice)
Modular setup is extremely scuffed and requires math to work in a modular way.
